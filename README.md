# multiple-images-to-one-txt
It's a script which recognises text from a sequence of images and outputs a txt file.
I have integrated 3 programs in my script
  1. Textcleaner  Download link ( www.fmwconcepts.com/imagemagick/downloadcounter.php?scriptname=textcleaner&dirname=textcleaner )
  2. imagemagick  Dowload (sudo apt-get install imagemagick)
  3. Tesseract    Download (sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr)
